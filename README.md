# Stories on Demand

## Description
This program will enable one to create their own unique story based on inputs made. As the user decides which types of inputs they'd like to select it will gather them all together. Inputs will be categorized based on noun, verb, adjective, etc. They will also be more specific at times to make the story less generic, such as movie name, building, type of dog, etc.
